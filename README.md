# Dotfiles
My Arch Linux dotfiles.

## Introduction

These dotfiles were written for a laptop setup with a dual-monitor option. I've always been middle ground between "minimalism" and usability, a fact that I believe is shown here. I've stripped away features I don't need (as much as I could get away with) and extended others. I want a computer that anybody familiar with mouse-heavy operating systems and environments can use, that is drastically extended by knowing your way around things.
