# arch-dotfiles
My Arch Linux dotfiles.

I tried to keep everything with a Solarised Light colour scheme. The GTK themes are Numix-Light Solarised, as are the Numix icons. I am using i3-gaps-next-git with i3blocks for my status bar.

## To do:

- Upload my screenshot/upload scripts.
- Finish setting up lid close/screen dim settings.
- Finish setting up tmux.
- Finish setting up conky.
- Find a way to detect if headphones are plugged in and automatically mute/unmute speakers.
- Edit some elements of the bar: workspace icons, font.
- Change console font.
- *Change the colour scheme.*
